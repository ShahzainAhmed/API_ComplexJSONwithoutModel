# APIs - Building List with Complex JSON Data without Model

## Reasons why the plugin (JSONtoDART) is not creating a Model for you 

- Backend developers in JSON file (postman) mistakenly has given space in parameters </br>
For example: 'address' written as 'addres s' (MISTAKE by backend developers)

- Most of the newbie backend developers do the mistake that they write the pre-defined keywords in the parameters. </br> Even if the plugin still makes you a model, then it will be having errors and issues in it. </br>
For example: 'new' as the name of the parameter. (Mistake is that 'new' is a keyword in Flutter)
